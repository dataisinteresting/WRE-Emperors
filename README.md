## Background

Here I juxtapose the reigns of a subset of Roman emperors against the (literal) arc of their lives.

Some things to note:

* The analysis here is superficial and I have not performed the kind of thorough consultation of primary sources necessary to formulate solid conclusions regarding manner of death. I am not a historian nor otherwise trained in historical methods. Dates in the original dataset are also largely estimates, and so I therefore gladly invite corrections to these data where necessary.

* Dates here are sourced from a dataset compiled by others here. Note in particular that the absolute values of BCE dates are decreased by 1 to conform to the ISO 8601 standard.
  - Thanks to zonination for creating this dataset.
  - Note: I did manually make some corrections to names in the final visualization.

* While I did rely on the aforementioned dataset for dates, I chose to review a different source for information on the deaths of emperors. I principally reviewed De Imperatoribus Romanis, a peer-reviewed encyclopedia of Roman rulers which I judged to be suitable for this project and which I noted as being used for a statistical analysis in a recent scholarly publication. It is recognized, however, that the writings there are generally decades old and may not reflect the most current scholarly consensus. Again, I invite corrections.

  - Thanks to Christian KÃ¶rner, Christopher J. Fuhrmann, David Wend, David Woods, Dennis Quinn, Garrett G. Fagan, Geoffrey Nathan, Hans A. Pohlsander, Herbert W. Benario, John Donahue, Michael DiMaio, Jr., Michael L. Meckler, Noel Lenski, Phoebe B. Peacock, R. Scott Moore, Ralph W. Mathisen, Richard D. Weigel, Robert Frakes, Robin McMahon, Thomas Banchich, Walter E. Roberts, and William Leadbetter for their contributions to De Imperatoribus Romanis which I reviewed in annotating probable manner of death.

* I mapped the descriptions of emperors deaths in De Imperatoribus Romanis to the same death classification scheme used in the original dataset's repository, as it seemed to reasonably capture the meaningful context of all emperors' deaths in the broad manner necessary for this visualization.

* Finally, thanks to David Bacci for showcasing the [Coronation Arc chart](https://github.com/PBI-David/Deneb-Showcase/blob/main/Coronation%20Arc%20Chart/Thumbnail.png) marking the coronation of Charles III of the United Kingdom. I was immediately struck by the elegance of that visualization and I am grateful for the availability of his Vega specifications which inspired this project.

#### Update 2025-03-01
I posted the first iteration of this graphic to Reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1iw1qce/oc_visualizing_the_lifetimes_and_reigns_of_a/) and received very useful feedback. I made the following changes based on this feedback:

* Changed the icon for Nerva's death to *natural causes* instead of *assassination*. I did have the corect manner of death recorded for Nerva, but placed the wrong icon when adding the iconography.
