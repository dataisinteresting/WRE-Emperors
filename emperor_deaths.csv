16,Marcus Aurelius,infectious disease,http://roman-emperors.sites.luc.edu/marcaur.htm,Herbert W. Benario,"Cassius Dio claims that following an illness ('νόσου') striking M. Aurelius, his physicians ended his life, possibly on Commodus's behalf: https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/72*.html
https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0593%3Abook%3D72%3Achapter%3Dpos%3D1699

Herodian claims that he was stricken with a  'violent disease' in Pannonia. Herodian describes him having summoned friends and relatives and directing them to guide Commodus after his death, which is claimed to have occurred one day after this event. https://archive.org/details/HerodiansHistoryOfHisOwnTimesOrOfTheRomanEmpireAfterMarcus/HerodiansHistoryOfHisOwnTimesOrOfTheRomanEmpireAfterMarcus/page/n61/mode/2up

The Historia Augusta claims that after becoming ill, he ceased eating and drinking, worsening his condition. Like Herodian, it is claimed that he died one day after conferring about his son with friends. Interestingly, it appears to be claimed that he referenced the ongoing plague during that meeting. Further, it is claimed, 'On the seventh day he was weary and admitted only his son, and even him he at once sent away in fear that he would catch the disease.'; the unreliability of the Historia Augusta notwithstanding, this may be supportive of the infectious disease hypothesis.

https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Marcus_Aurelius/1*.html#note95

The above is all sourced from translations which may lead to simplistic and erroneous conclusions; for example we should not conclude that M. Aurelius died of the Antonine Plague simply because the Historia Augusta claims he made reference to it and 'sent away' his son (and this too presupposes that the translation here is a faithful representation of the original writing). All that being said, the breadth of the sources appear to mostly agree that M. Aurelius died on campaign in Pannonia of some illness; the apparently intense onset and the descriptions we have of his condition -vague as they are- would be consistent with a death from infectious disease. The historical record showing that the Antonine plague was still ongoing around the time of his death perhaps adds some plausibility -thought not certainty- to this hypothesis.

17,Lucius Verus,natural causes,http://roman-emperors.sites.luc.edu/lverus.htm,Phoebe B. Peacock,"See Chapter 8 of 'Lucius Verus and the Roman Defence of the East' by M.C. Bishop for a discussion of plausible causes of death. Causes of a natural nature appear to be most plausible, but there doesn't appear to be quite sufficient evidence for a categorization of infectious disease despite this occurring during the Antonine Plague. 

Cassius Dio apparently claims that he was poisoned, but this doesn't appear to be well supported. https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/cassius_dio/71*.html#2

Tangentially, a German study on the use of 'apoplexy' by medical writers in antiquity is here: https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/s-2007-996355. We encounter this term frequently in reading translations of classical works and it's important to note that it is used in a different manner than the modern sense.
